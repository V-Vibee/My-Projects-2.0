**Introduction:** Customer Churn prediction means knowing which customers are likely to leave or unsubscribe from your service. For many companies, this is an important prediction. Especially seen in banking domain, and is crucial to know, because acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you’ve identified customers at risk of churn, you need to know exactly what marketing efforts you should make with each customer to maximize their likelihood of staying. Customers have different behaviors and preferences, and reasons for cancelling their subscriptions. Therefore, it is important to actively communicate with each of them to keep them on your customer list.


**Why is Analyzing Customer Churn Prediction Important..?** 
A company with a high churn rate loses many subscribers, resulting in lower growth rates and a greater impact on sales and profits. Companies with low churn rates can retain customers.



**What is it used for..?** Customer churn is important because it costs more to acquire new customers than to sell to the existing customers. This is the metric that determines the success or failure of a business, Since satisfied customers tend to bring in more repeated business. Hence Successful customer retention increases the customer’s average lifetime value, making all future sales more valuable and improving unit margins.

The way to maximize a company’s resources is often by increasing revenue from recurring subscriptions and trusted repeat business rather than investing in acquiring new customers. Retaining loyal customers for years makes it much easier to grow and weather financial hardship than spending money to acquire new customers to replace those who have left.



**Benefits of Analyzing Customer Churn Prediction:**
1. Improve the customer experience.
2. Optimize your products and services.
3. Customer retention.



**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Linear Regression.
2. Support Vector Machine.
3. Decison Tree.
4. Random Forest.
5. XG Boost.
   
**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing/ Cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Handling Categorical data using One hot encoding.
- Handling imbalanced data- using SMOTE.
- Model Building , checking accuracy score as well as classifictaion nreport to know models Precision and Reacall.
- Final selecting the model and save as Joblib file.
- Cross check prediction using GUI window.


 **Best Model Selection Criterion**
