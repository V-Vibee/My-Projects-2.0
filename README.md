**Introduction:** Customer Churn prediction means knowing which customers are likely to leave or unsubscribe from your service. For many companies, this is an important prediction. Especially seen in banking domain, and is crucial to know, because acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you’ve identified customers at risk of churn, you need to know exactly what marketing efforts you should make with each customer to maximize their likelihood of staying. Customers have different behaviors and preferences, and reasons for cancelling their subscriptions. Therefore, it is important to actively communicate with each of them to keep them on your customer list.

A company with a high churn rate loses many subscribers, resulting in lower growth rates and a greater impact on sales and profits. Companies with low churn rates can retain customers.



**What is it used for..?** Customer churn is important because it costs more to acquire new customers than to sell to the existing customers. This is the metric that determines the success or failure of a business, Since satisfied customers tend to bring in more repeated business.

1. Improve the customer experience.
2. Optimize your products and services.
3. Customer retention.



**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Linear Regression.
2. Support Vectoir Machine.
